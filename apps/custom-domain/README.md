# custom-domain

Centralized service for managing custom domains with DNS verification and SSL provisioning.

## Routes and scopes

HTTP routes served by the application and what each one requires. `public` routes need no bearer token or session.

| Method | Path | Required scope / role / auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | public | Root endpoint |
| GET | `/health` | public | Health check endpoint |

Swagger UI (`/docs`), ReDoc (`/redoc`) and `/openapi.json` are served only when `DOCS_ENABLED` is true.
